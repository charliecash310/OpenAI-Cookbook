# OpenAI-Cookbook
This project portfolio work related to the ChatGPT for Cybersecurity Cookbook by Packt - I specifically asked ChatGPT to configure these files for Linux only. 

I'll do another project further down the road on a Windows Virtual Machine. Alot can change in both a short and long amount of time. But luckily the use of ChatGPT really helped get me up to speed not only as an assistant but as a teacher.
