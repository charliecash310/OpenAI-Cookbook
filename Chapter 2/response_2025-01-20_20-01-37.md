# Question
What else can you tell me about the installation?

# Answer
 The installation involves updating the Ubuntu software, installing pre-requisite software, installing Suricata and EveBox, reviewing the Suricata configuration, determining the network address used by Suricata, and enabling and updating the Suricata rules for detection and classification of traffic. The installation also involves reviewing the Suricata configuration variables, such as default-rule-path, af-packet, and file-store. There are also options to enable sources for rule updates, such as oisf/trafficid, tgreen/hunting, and sslbl/ja3-fingerprints.
