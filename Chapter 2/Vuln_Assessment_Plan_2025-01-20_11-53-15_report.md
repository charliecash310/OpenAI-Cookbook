### Vulnerability Assessment Plan

#### 1. Introduction:
The purpose of this vulnerability assessment plan is to identify and mitigate potential security weaknesses within the small network environment consisting of 25 nodes, including servers and workstations. The assessment aims to improve the overall security posture of the organization by proactively identifying vulnerabilities that could be exploited by threat actors. Compliance with GDPR and PCI-DSS regulations will also be ensured as part of this assessment.

#### 2. Process/Methodology:
- **Scope Definition**: Identify the network size, nodes, excluded devices, operating systems, network topology, access controls, compliance requirements, business critical assets, data classification, goals, timeline, team, deliverables, and audience.
- **Information Gathering**: Collect network information, device details, and existing security controls.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Perform automated scans using vulnerability assessment tools.
- **Manual Verification**: Validate critical findings through manual testing and verification.
- **Risk Prioritization**: Classify vulnerabilities based on severity and potential impact.
- **Mitigation Recommendations**: Provide actionable recommendations to address identified vulnerabilities.
- **Reporting**: Compile a detailed vulnerability assessment report with findings and recommendations.

#### 3. Tools Required:
- **Vulnerability Scanning Tools**: Nessus, OpenVAS, Nexpose
- **Configuration Review Tools**: Nmap, Qualys
- **Compliance Check Tools**: Lynis, Wazuh
- **Manual Verification Tools**: Burp Suite, Wireshark

#### 4. Assessment Steps:
1. **Scope Definition**:
   - Identify network size, nodes, excluded devices, operating systems, network topology, access controls, compliance requirements, business critical assets, data classification, goals, timeline, team, deliverables, and audience.

2. **Information Gathering**:
   - Collect network diagrams, device inventories, and access control lists.

3. **Vulnerability Scanning**:
   - Conduct automated vulnerability scans using Nessus, OpenVAS, and Nexpose.

4. **Manual Verification**:
   - Validate critical findings through manual testing using Burp Suite for web applications and Wireshark for network traffic analysis.

5. **Risk Prioritization**:
   - Classify vulnerabilities based on severity (CVSS score), exploitability, and potential impact on business critical assets.

6. **Mitigation Recommendations**:
   - Provide detailed remediation steps for each identified vulnerability, prioritizing critical issues affecting GDPR and PCI-DSS compliance.

7. **Reporting**:
   - Prepare a comprehensive vulnerability assessment report including an executive summary, detailed findings, risk prioritization, mitigation recommendations, and a roadmap for improving the security posture.

#### Conclusion:
By following this vulnerability assessment plan, the IT Security Team will be able to identify and remediate security vulnerabilities within the small network environment, ultimately improving the organization's security posture and ensuring compliance with GDPR and PCI-DSS regulations. The deliverables will include a vulnerability report and actionable recommendations tailored for IT management.
